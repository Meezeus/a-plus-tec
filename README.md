# A+ Tec Game

[A+ Tec](http://www.aplustec.org/) is a Saturday school specialising in
mathematics and science tutoring. This is a game I made while working there
part-time as a teacher. The game is similar to a crossword puzzle, except that
numbers replace the words and the hints are maths equations that need to be
solved.

## Usage

The easiest way to run the program is to download the *.jar* file and double
click it (make sure you have [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) installed and set
in your PATH).

If you wish to run the program from an IDE, I recommend using
[IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). First clone the repo and then open
it in IntelliJ, making sure to set the project SDK. Download
[JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) and add it as a project library. Then start from
the application using the *Main* class.

To package the program into a single *.jar* file, run the *package* lifecycle
using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
